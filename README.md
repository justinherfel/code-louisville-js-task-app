##Overview
This project contains one HTML file, one CSS file, and 3 separate JavaScript files. The HTML file contains three separate apps inside. Each of the three apps include a feature from the features list.##

**Project Feature:
Your application must have a responsive design through the use of media queries, Bootstrap, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and/or other similar approaches - we need to ensure that you can integrate your new JavaScript skills with your HTML/CSS skills you previously learned. We will test your site on at least two different screen sizes (mobile and desktop) and must see that you’ve incorporated some element of responsive design to it.**

I included a media query at 900px where the mobile-first layout changes from a single column to a horizontal row, with the task manager app on the left, temperature app in the middle, and the pie chart on the right.

**Project Feature:
Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits. Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git command line.**

The file has been uploaded to my GitHub repository with over 20 commits using the Git command line.

**Project Feature:
Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application.**

The task manager app allows the user to input words into the text field, and once complete, the user must click the 'Click to Add Item' button, which populates below. To the right of that added item are two buttons, 'Edit Item' and 'Delete Item'. If the user clicks 'Edit Item', a field below opens up with whatever text the user typed inside, allowing that text to be edited as needed. Once complete, click the 'Click to Save Edits' button below and the entry is updated. If the user clicks 'Delete Item', then the item will be deleted. In summary, this app creates an array and populates a list with multiple values. Each entry can be retrieved individually, edited and either saved/updated or deleted.

**Project Feature: 
Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams).**

The second app in the HTML file is the Temperature Converter app. This app is fairly straightforward. In the 'Fahrenheit' box, you type the temperature that you want converted into Celsius. The JavaScript file temp.js holds the script which converts the Fahrenheit immediately into Celsius below.

**Project Feature:
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.**

Using Chart.js v2.9.4, I created a pie chart showing the top 5 largest wine producting countries by percentage from 2018. The data is pulled from an array in the chart.js file.
